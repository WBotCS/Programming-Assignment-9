This is part of CPTS 122 Final Project.
We worked as a team to roll out this final project with our team members, Waddhanabot Yi, Micah Moody, Brandon Truong and Aayush Aesthresha.
This project is similar to other gaming project (Crossy Road), we took the inspiration and made it our own ways.
The main requirement for this project is for us to use inheritance and SFML to create a game or an application in some sorts.
Language: C++
